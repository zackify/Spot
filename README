1. Edit Spot/connect.php with mysql details and import spot.sql
2. Follow the example.php page or do the following:
- Open a document that you want to use
- Add
<?php require('Spot/start.php'); 
echo Create_User('user','pass'); // change this to the username / pass you want
?>
to the top of your PHP document

- Add <script src="Spot/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="Spot/editing.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
in between <head> and </head>

- Anywhere that you want to be editable just add <?php echo Spot('Unique Name');?>

- Maybe add a link to Spot/Admin so you can login on the page
- Now save the page 
- Refresh it twice and go to /Spot/Admin to login
- now you can edit the elements you chose!

Tips: 
- When editing you must click out of the box for things to be saved.
- Visit the login page on a mobile device to use the mobile version
